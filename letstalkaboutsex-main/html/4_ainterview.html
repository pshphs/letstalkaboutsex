            <div class="right-question">What do you think about birth control pills?</div>
            <div class="right-answer"><p>
                I have a positive view of birth control pills. Nowadays, sexual culture has become more natural compared to our time. Back then, it was a big deal to travel with your boyfriend, and I thought it would lead to serious trouble. If those situations happened, people had to lie to be able to travel. Unplanned pregnancies would sometimes lead to marriages that people didn’t really want, but using birth control pills helped lessen this problem. It gave people more control over their decisions about having children.</p></div>
            <div class="number" id="number2">(2)</div>
            <div class="left-question">You mentioned earlier that you have a positive view of birth control pills.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you explain why you feel that way?</div>
            <div class="left-answer"><p>
              The main worry is when pregnancies happen unexpectedly. I saw a situation where the girlfriend of my son’s friend got pregnant only a few months into their relationship. They felt pressured to get married but ended up getting divorced recently. This made my son concerned about going through a similar situation. I think it’s important for women to use contraception once they start dating someone. It’s not good for their bodies to have a pregnancy they didn’t plan for and then have to get an abortion. Recently, I learned that there are more options besides just birth control pills and condoms when I saw my daughter using a contraceptive device, like a loop implant in her arm.</p></div>
            <div class="number" id="number3">(3)</div>
            <div class="right-question">How did you practice contraception?</div>
            <div class="right-answer"><p>I believe my husband and I relied solely on condoms. We didn’t choose to have a vasectomy, and I didn’t take birth control pills myself.</p></div>
            <div class="number" id="number4">(4)</div>
            <div class="left-question">Did you receive any information about birth control pills?</div>
            <div class="left-answer"><p>No, I didn’t. I didn’t really focus on it and just went along with what my husband wanted. I heard stories of women getting pregnant even while using condoms, but luckily, we were fortunate and didn’t experience any issues with preventing pregnancy.</p></div>
            <div class="number" id="number5">(5)</div>
            <div class="right-question">Are you familiar with the dosage and potential side effects of birth control pills?</div>
            <div class="right-answer"><p>No, not at all. I didn’t know anything about it, and I wasn’t even aware that there were different types available. When I thought about it later, I realized that I lived without even considering these things.</p></div>
            <div class="number" id="number6">(6)</div>
            <div class="left-question">Would you recommend birth control pills to people around you or your children?</div>
            <div class="left-answer"><p>It’s important to plan for child birth and similar things. However, when I thought about it carefully, I realized that birth control pills are used by women, apart from condoms and vasectomy. It doesn’t seem good for the body to forcefully stop natural processes, right? It feels like it disturbs the natural balance. I have some concerns about that, but since many people use them these days, maybe it’s not a big problem.</p></div>
            <div class="number" id="number7">(7)</div>
            <div class="right-question">Do you go to the gynecologist regularly?</div>
            <div class="right-answer"><p>I don’t need to go anymore (laughs). These days, young people visit gynecologists on a regular basis. But I ended up not going much after giving birth. It might seem unusual in the eyes of mothers nowadays. Our generation was able to have children without all that.</p></div>
            <div class="number" id="number8">(8)</div>
            <div class="left-question">So, do you think it’s less necessary to see a gynecologist?</div>
            <div class="left-answer"><p>I think it’s still important. In the past, due to ignorance or economic and social reasons, I felt reluctant to go. Nowadays, there are many advancements in gynecology, so I would recommend going. However, back in our time, there was a negative perception unmarried women visited gynecologists. I’m not sure if it was just me, but I felt there was a fixed mindset around that.</p></div>
            <div class="number" id="number9">(9)</div>
            <div class="right-question">Did you visit the gynecologist more frequently after getting married?</div>
            <div class="right-answer"><p>Yes, I started going only after getting married. Before that, I rarely went, except for a couple of times when I had vaginal infections.</p></div>
            <div class="number" id="number10">(10)</div>
            <div class="left-question">Were you curious about sex or your own body and did you ask questions?</div>
            <div class="left-answer"><p>No, I didn’t ask anything, and apart from the times I had problems with my private area, I didn’t have any detailed discussions. There was a belief back then that we shouldn’t think or talk much about sex.</p></div>
            <div class="number" id="number11">(11)</div>
            <div class="right-question">Did you learn about sex, birth control, or pregnancy in school or anywhere else?</div>
            <div class="right-answer"><p>In middle school, we had a brief session, and in high school, we didn’t receive any comprehensive sex education. It was mostly limited to watching videos, and that was the extent of it. So, you can imagine how little knowledge we had. I’m curious, though, has sex education improved in your generation? Are they providing more comprehensive education now?</p></div>
            <div class="number" id="number12">(12)</div>
            <div class="left-question">We did learn about it in school, but it seemed like nobody really cared about it. It was taught in a strict and secretive way, like it was only about the meeting of sperm and egg.</div>
            <div class="left-answer"><p>Yes, that’s right. Because they taught it that way in school, I also felt a bit unsure about talking to my child about it. I did talk to my son about it before, but I couldn’t go into details, so I just told him to be careful.</p></div>
            <div class="number" id="number13">(13)</div>
            <div class="right-question">I haven’t had a detailed conversation with my parents either. So, how do you talk to your daughters about it?</div>
            <div class="right-answer"><p>Oh, really? (laughs) I don’t talk to my daughters about everything either, but I do talk to them about their physical health. I don’t go into details about sexual relationships though. My daughter had a surgery in her uterus, and I found out about her contraception method afterwards, but I don’t know exactly how she’s practicing.</p></div>
            <div class="number" id="number14">(14)</div><div class="left-question">Did you ever discuss sex with your friends?</div>
            <div class="left-answer"><p>No, I didn’t. It was surprising and refreshing when your mom mentioned that you were doing a project about sex and talking openly about it. Even in our small group, if sex talk comes up, we feel embarrassed and quickly change the subject. (laughs) We are all too innocent, but we’re already in our 60s, so I wondered if it’s still inappropriate to have such conversations. Talking about sex is so awkward and not something we’re used to, so it feels embarrassing. That’s why I’m so thankful to you for creating this opportunity. I thought this interview was groundbreaking, and it made me reconsider things. It’s great, but it’s the first time I’m having a proper conversation like this, so I had to gather my thoughts before the interview.</p></div>
            <div class="number" id="number15">(15)</div>
            <div class="right-question">Yes, that’s right. When I mentioned doing interviews about this topic for the project, I initially thought of it as something casual, but after thinking about it more, I realized it could be burdensome for you.</div>
            <div class="right-answer"><p>No, not at all. I believe that such conversations should always happen. Even topics that used to be awkward should be talked about more casually.</p></div>
            <div class="number" id="number16">(16)</div>
            <div class="left-question">Did you talk to your husband about it often?</div>
            <div class="left-answer"><p>No, I didn’t. One of my friends, on the other hand, has been talking about these things with her husband since they were young. So their relationship is still great. Even though we’ve been together for over 40 years, we’ve never had those kinds of conversations, and now I regret it. I think if we had been more honest about how we feel, our relationship would have been smoother. I used to think that as a woman, I shouldn’t reveal my thoughts and should pretend not to know, so I never expressed my opinions when it came to our sexual experience. So we need to have more conversations. Women also have the right to enjoy. I don’t understand why we always have to be passive. Communication is an important part of building a relationship.</p></div>
            <div class="number" id="number17">(17)</div>
            <div class="right-question">Do you have any hopes for future sex education or sexual culture?</div>
            <div class="right-answer"><p>Well, when I think about it, I wish they had taught us about these things more openly when we were in school. Even just watching videos about it made me feel uncomfortable... It would have been better if it wasn’t just a one-time thing, but if we had regular sessions to learn and talk about it. I also hope that parents can find better ways to talk to their children about sex. Like how we’re sitting here and having a conversation today, it feels natural and can help us have a more open-minded view about sex, don’t you think? At first, kids might feel awkward, but if we keep trying and putting effort into it, it could become more natural over time.</p></div>
            <div class="number" id="number18">(18)</div>
            <div class="left-question">I’m sure there were some difficult questions, but I really appreciate your honest answers.</div>
            <div class="left-answer" id="last-answer"><p>No, today’s conversation with you was refreshing and so much fun. I think you’ll learn a lot from this project, and by sharing taboo topics like this, we’re breaking barriers.</p></div>
