            <div class="number" id="number1">(1)</div>
            <div class="right-question">What do you think about birth control pills?</div>
            <div class="right-answer"><p>
              I haven’t personally tried them, but I learned about them from magazines. On TV, they weren’t shown much because they were often censored or considered sensitive topic. Women’s magazines had advertisements, but I didn’t know much about how to use them or their effects.</p></div>
            <div class="number" id="number2">(2)</div>
            <div class="left-question">Do you know about the side effects and effectiveness?</div>
            <div class="left-answer"><p>
              I heard that taking them for a long time may cause side effects like weight gain.</p></div>
            <div class="number" id="number3">(3)</div>
            <div class="right-question">What is your perception of birth control pills?</div>
            <div class="right-answer"><p>Since I haven’t taken them, I used to have a negative opinion. But now, I think they have improved with medical advancements, so I see them more positively, even though I don’t use them.</p></div>
            <div class="number" id="number4">(4)</div>
            <div class="left-question">Have you ever talked about these topics with your children?</div>
            <div class="left-answer"><p>No, I haven’t. When I talked to my daughter, I felt that she is conservative about sex compared to other young people. I thought she already knows everything without me needing to talk specifically about it. Like how I learned from magazines, she can learn well from the internet without my interference.</p></div>
            <div class="number" id="number5">(5)</div>
            <div class="right-question">Where do you think people can find such information nowadays?</div>
            <div class="right-answer"><p>Hmm, I haven’t really thought about where to find information since I’m not particularly interested in the topic. But these days, information is more easily available compared to the past. Whether it’s on TV, the internet, or social media, information isn’t as hidden as it used to be. So, I think even elementary school students would know a lot if they wanted to find it.</p></div>
            <div class="number" id="number6">(6)</div>
            <div class="left-question">Do you visit the gynecologist regularly?</div>
            <div class="left-answer"><p>I used to go more often if I felt something was wrong or for regular check-ups. Just like going to a regular doctor when you have a cold, if there’s an issue related to that area, it’s natural to go.</p></div>
            <div class="number" id="number7">(7)</div>
            <div class="right-question">Apart from birth control pills, do you know and use other ways to prevent pregnancy?</div>
            <div class="right-answer"><p>At the gynecologist’s, they inserted a contraceptive device for me, so I know that one.</p></div>
            <div class="number" id="number8">(8)</div>
            <div class="left-question">Did you talk about these topics openly with your husband?</div>
            <div class="left-answer"><p>I haven’t specifically talked about it since deciding not to have any more children. And since it’s my body, and I have no plans to have another child, I didn’t think it was necessary to consult with him</p></div>
            <div class="number" id="number9">(9)</div>
            <div class="right-question">Did your parents or friends talk about sex when you were growing up?</div>
            <div class="right-answer"><p>Why bother? Back in the days, we talked more about dating than sex. We didn’t discuss sex in detail. I considered it a bad and serious topic to talk about, so I didn’t have much interest in that area. After getting married, it became more natural to talk about it, but I still didn’t bring up the topic unless it was necessary.</p></div>
            <div class="number" id="number10">(10)</div>
            <div class="left-question">Did you learn about sex in school?</div>
            <div class="left-answer"><p>We had some sex education during biology class, but they only briefly explained general facts. They didn’t go into much detail about the process. It was more like giving us basic information that a baby is made when the egg and sperm meet.</p></div>
            <div class="number" id="number11">(11)</div>
            <div class="right-question">What are your thoughts on that education?</div>
            <div class="right-answer"><p>I believe sex education is not just about sitting in a classroom and being told all the little details. It’s something we naturally learn as we grow up and interact with different people. In my opinion, sex education should also include teaching moral values. It’s about instilling the understanding that women should take care of their bodies and maintain their human dignity. While it’s important to learn about different contraceptive methods, it’s not just about preventing pregnancy but also about protecting oneself, one’s family, and ultimately building a healthier society.</p></div>
            <div class="number" id="number12">(12)</div>
            <div class="left-question">From a social perspective, it seems important. Lastly, how did you feel when I mentioned that I wanted to interview you on this topic?</div>
            <div class="left-answer" id="last-answer"><p>(Laughs) If it were a stranger, I would have probably felt more comfortable. Even though you’re an adult now, I’ve seen you as a baby since you were born, so to me, you’re still a baby to me. So, it was a bit difficult to process when you called me about your sex project. That’s why I find it even more challenging to talk to my own daughter about sex.</p></div>
