            <div class="right-question">What do you think about birth control pills?</div>
            <div class="right-answer"><p>
              I never really thought about using birth control pills. I think they have strong stuff in them that might be bad for the body because they stop the sperm and egg from meeting. I feel like I shouldn’t take them without knowing what’s inside and how they affect me. So, I never looked into them too much.</p></div>
            <div class="number" id="number2">(2)</div>
            <div class="left-question">Have you heard any information from gynecologists or people around you?</div>
            <div class="left-answer"><p>
              I haven’t really talked about it with my parents, so I don’t know. I also haven’t discussed it much with my friends. However, I did find it interesting when one of my friends took birth control pills about 20 years ago. It was the first time I learned about what they looked like and how to take them. Since I wasn’t interested, I never asked my doctor about it either.</p></div>
            <div class="number" id="number3">(3)</div>
            <div class="right-question">Do you visit the gynecologist regularly?</div>
            <div class="right-answer"><p>I go for regular check-ups every two years, but other than that, I don’t have any reason to go since I’m older now. However, when I was younger, I went for issues related to pregnancy or menstruation. I had excessive bleeding during my period, and when I went to the doctor, they found a polyp in my uterus. That’s when I started visiting the gynecologist more frequently. The doctor recommended IUD to prevent excessive bleeding, but I hesitated because it involved inserting something into my body, so I ultimately didn’t do it.</p></div>
            <div class="number" id="number4">(4)</div>
            <div class="left-question">Was that the first time you heard about the IUD?</div>
            <div class="left-answer"><p>No, it wasn’t. It happened in my early 50s when I had abnormal bleeding. As for contraception, in the past, we were really ignorant, you know? I’ve heard some people say that if you wash with cola right after having sex, you won’t get pregnant. Of course, I thought it was ridiculous, but we couldn’t use the internet to confirm it. I wondered if there were any books with detailed information at the bookstore.</p></div>
            <div class="number" id="number5">(5)</div>
            <div class="right-question">Do you often discuss sex, including contraception, with your friends?</div>
            <div class="right-answer"><p>I haven’t talked about it much. However, among the things I learned, the most significant ones were from my friends. But even then, it was mostly informational, and we didn’t share more personal or detailed experiences. But I thought that nowadays people are more open about sex or is it still similar these days?</p></div>
            <div class="number" id="number6">(6)</div>
            <div class="left-question">No, we definitely talk about sex much more casually. Do you have any hopes for sex education?</div>
            <div class="left-answer"><p>I think it would be better if they provided objective knowledge and expanded it in a more open and diverse way. How to use contraception and how women experience menstruation, for example. I read an article a few days ago that mentioned in the United States, a drug is gaining popularity and causing a rise in addiction. However, in Colombia, a similar situation occurred before, but their open education approach prevented an increase in addiction and reduced drug-related deaths. If we leave it for children to figure out on their own, there’s a higher chance of getting involved in negative things, it seems.</p></div>
            <div class="number" id="number7">(7)</div>
            <div class="right-question">Do you talk about sex-related matters with your family members?</div>
            <div class="right-answer"><p>No, I don’t. I had a conversation with my eldest son once when he was in 8th grade. It happened naturally, but I still find it difficult to talk about sex in casual manner. I just warned him to be cautious about unwanted pregnancies with his girlfriend, as I was worried about how it could change his life. I didn’t go into deeper details. And I can’t remember the last time I talked about it with my husband. We’re old folks, so we don’t discuss those things. (laughs)</p></div>
            <div class="number" id="number8">(8)</div>
            <div class="left-question">How did you prevent pregnancy when you were younger?</div>
            <div class="left-answer" id="last-answer"><p>My husband had an operation, so I didn’t have to worry about it. In the 1950s and 1960s, many people of our age group had vasectomy if they didn’t want more children. There were some beliefs and rumors about the procedure. In our parents’ generation, it was agreed upon in society that having only one child was best because Korea had a large population. During that time, vasectomy was encouraged. If you had the surgery, you would even be exempted from military training, and it was easy to get it done anywhere. I remember discussing with friends where our husbands should get the surgery. (laughs) As a result, false rumors spread, like gaining weight or losing energy after the surgery. Our generation is not very familiar with birth control pills. Normally, I don’t talk much about these things, but since you’re working on a project, it made me think about it, and I also found it very interesting.</p></div>
