            <div class="right-question">What do you think about birth control pills?</div>
            <div class="right-answer"><p>
              I think birth control pills are important because they help prevent unplanned pregnancies when people have sex without protection. It can be difficult for everyone involved if a pregnancy happens unexpectedly, so it’s good to promote the use of birth control.</p></div>
            <div class="number" id="number2">(2)</div>

            <div class="left-question">Do you know about birth control pills or have you used them?</div>
            <div class="left-answer"><p>
              In the past, I learned about birth control pills from ads in women’s magazines. But, it’s best to get guidance from a doctor when using birth control, not just pills but also methods like tubal ligation or IUDs. Taking birth control pills requires caution and keeping track of when to take them. Sometimes people forget or miss taking them, and the effects on their bodies can vary. It’s not just a concern for women, but I think men may not take it as seriously.</p></div>
            <div class="number" id="number3">(3)</div>
            <div class="right-question">Do you know how birth control pills are used, how they look, or their side effects?</div>

            <div class="right-answer"><p>Apart from knowing that they need to be taken daily, I’m not sure about the specifics. I can guess how they look based on what I’ve seen in magazines, but I haven’t personally used them. Birth control pills reduce the chance of getting pregnant but can also affect how the body works. So, they may not be completely good for the body, and it’s better to avoid using them if possible.</p></div>

            <div class="number" id="number4">(4)</div>
            <div class="left-question">Are you familiar with other birth control methods?</div>
            <div class="left-answer"><p>After I had my youngest child, I had a procedure called tubal ligation to prevent future pregnancies. I think it would be better if men also underwent such procedures, but since my husband didn’t, I had it done.</p></div>

            <div class="number" id="number5">(5)</div>
            <div class="right-question">Do you have a positive or negative perception of birth control pills?</div>
            <div class="right-answer"><p>I have mixed feelings about birth control pills. When I was in college, I heard that they could help regulate periods when traveling. Additionally, I heard that taking them for an extended period would prevent pregnancy. Although I’m not sure why, I heard this from multiple people, so I believed it at the time. If there are no other options, birth control pills can be useful for regulating the reproductive system. However, I preferred not to take them unnecessarily and believed that there are other effective methods of contraception.</p></div>
            <div class="number" id="number6">(6)</div>
            <div class="left-question">Have you discussed sex-related topics with friends or people around you?</div>
            <div class="left-answer"><p>No, I haven’t. We talked about health-related matters, but we never specifically had discussions about sex. I also felt like there was no need to discuss such topics, and I assumed others felt the same way. As a result, most of my knowledge about sex came from books and magazines, which sometimes made me feel uninformed.</p></div>
            <div class="number" id="number7">(7)</div>
            <div class="right-question">Do you visit the gynecologist regularly? If so, do you feel comfortable during those visits?</div>
            <div class="right-answer"><p>No, I don’t feel comfortable. I generally dislike going to hospitals, and visiting the gynecologist is no exception. Since I haven’t had any major issues, I haven’t felt the need to go for regular check-ups</p></div>
            <div class="number" id="number8">(8)</div>
            <div class="left-question">What are your thoughts on sex education?</div>
            <div class="left-answer"><p>The sex education I received and the popular video tapes about sex when my first child was young were both not very clear. The videos were in a cartoon format which made it interesting for my son, but looking back, I think they didn’t show sex realistically. For example, the video showed a couple going to bed together, then the sperm meeting the egg, and suddenly a baby was born. Sex is a private topic, and in a society where discussing it is considered impure and revealing, people naturally avoid talking about it. Instead of keeping it a secret and living like that, I wish we had more open education from a young age. But these days, there are many YouTubers who present sex education in a casual manner, and there is a wealth of information available in books and on the internet. You can get a lot of information when needed from different medias.</p></div>
            <div class="number" id="number9">(9)</div>
            <div class="right-question">You mentioned that nowadays many people talk about sex through different media. How do you think people who haven’t had personal experience understand these discussions?</div>
            <div class="right-answer"><p>I don’t think they fully understand until they actually have sex. Sexual relationships involve physical actions and personal experience. People learn about it subconsciously by accumulating information over time.</p></div>
            <div class="number" id="number10">(10)</div>
            <div class="left-question">Have you ever had open discussions about sex with your family or friends?</div>
            <div class="left-answer"><p>No, I haven’t. I never had such discussions, especially with my father. My mother only told me to take care of my body as a woman, but we never talked about sex. I talked about things like menstrual cramps with my sisters, but we never discussed other aspects of sex.</p></div>
            <div class="number" id="number11">(11)</div>
            <div class="right-question">How did you satisfy your curiosity if you didn’t talk about it with friends and family?</div>
            <div class="right-answer" id="last-answer"><p>Mostly by reading books and magazines. Even though they didn’t provide explicit details, I could understand the general information and know that such things existed. There were times when I was quite interested, but afterward, I didn’t get myself so into it.</p></div>
