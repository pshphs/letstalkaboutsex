      <div class="right-question">What do you think about birth control pills? Do you have a positive or negative
        perception of them?</div>
      <div class="right-answer">
        <p>
          I think birth control pills are important for those who need them, especially for married people. Personally,
          I don’t have a negative opinion, but I think they need planning and may not be very effective.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="number" id="number2">(2)</div>
      <div class="left-question">Do you have any experience or knowledge about how to take birth control pills, their
        effectiveness, side effects, or personal experiences?</div>
      <div class="left-answer">
        <p>
          I don’t have any personal experience to share. In our case, my husband had a vasectomy, so I never had to take
          them. However, I have heard that some people use birth control pills to treat acne and have seen their skin
          get better.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="number" id="number3">(3)</div>
      <div class="right-question">Do you know anyone who takes birth control pills?</div>
      <div class="right-answer">
        <p>I’ve heard from my friends that some people take birth control pills because their partners don’t want to use
          condoms. They mentioned that it can be challenging because you have to remember to take them every day and be
          consistent. It may not be easy for women to use them regularly. It requires ongoing care, which can be
          inconvenient and unnecessary. However, in case of unexpected situations, emergency contraception pills are
          available and effective, so they can consider using them.</p>

      <div class="left-question">You mentioned being a school teacher. When you were still teaching at school, did you
        have conversations or counseling sessions with students regarding sex?</div>
      <div class="left-answer">
        <p>Rather than having specific conversations about it, I had experiences where I provided counseling and support
          after incidents occurred. Students didn’t generally come to teachers to openly discuss these matters.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="number" id="number5">(5)</div>
      <div class="right-question">What do you think about sex education?</div>
      <div class="right-answer">
        <p>Around 30 to 40 years ago, discussions about human bodies were mentioned during family or biology classes.
          Later, in the 90s, schools started teaching sex education as a mandatory subject, and we also invited speakers
          to give special lectures on the topic. These speakers came once or twice a year, but I don’t think students
          found them very helpful. It seemed like they learned things gradually through their friends. When I was a
          teacher, I noticed that some male students carried condoms. I was surprised, but I didn’t confiscate or
          discuss it with them because they carried them for their own caution.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="number" id="number6">(6)</div>
      <div class="left-question">Did you observe female students carrying condoms?</div>
      <div class="left-answer">
        <p>I haven’t observed how female students handle it. It seemed like they dealt with it when the need arose
          rather than being prepared in advance. I felt that they had fewer chances to prepare than male students.
          Discussing these matters may have been considered taboo for them as well. Even if I’m not their parents, as a
          third party, it may have been uncomfortable to talk about it for them.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="number" id="number7">(7)</div>
      <div class="right-question">Have you received any concerns from your family regarding sex?</div>
      <div class="right-answer">
        <p>We haven’t had any such conversations in our family, and it’s even more difficult to discuss as family
          members. We would prefer not to engage in those topics. While it may be necessary and desired, we haven’t
          mentioned it, and as a result, we still haven’t talked about it.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="number" id="number8">(8)</div>
      <div class="left-question">How did you come across information about contraception?</div>
      <div class="left-answer">
        <p>After getting married and starting a sexual relationship with my husband, I looked for ways for women to
          prevent pregnancy. I found two options: birth control pills and IUDs. But both seemed inconvenient, and I
          thought it would be easier if my husband took the responsibility for contraception. So, I appreciated that he
          was the one getting the procedure and I didn’t have to deal with any of that.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="number" id="number9">(9)</div>
      <div class="right-question">When did you first visit a gynecologist?</div>
      <div class="right-answer">
        <p>I visited a gynecologist for the first time after I became pregnant. After that, I went for regular check-ups
          after having two children, but before marriage, I had never visited a gynecologist. Going to a gynecologist
          had a negative perception at that time. Unmarried women going to a gynecologist were not viewed positively in
          society, so I didn’t feel the need to go, and I didn’t think it was necessary.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="number" id="number10">(10)</div>
      <div class="left-question">Did you feel comfortable visiting a gynecologist?</div>
      <div class="left-answer">
        <p>It was uncomfortable. Since I had to show the most secretive part of my body to stranger, I specifically
          looked for female doctors when visiting gynecologists. After the 80s and into the 90s, I slowly let go of
          narrow-minded thoughts about visiting gynecologists.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="number" id="number11">(11)</div>
      <div class="right-question">Do you have any desire or hopes for sex education?</div>
      <div class="right-answer" id="last-answer">
        <p>Even as a mother with children, I’m not sure what I should teach them and how to effectively teach them about
          these matters. I can advise them to be cautious when it comes to meeting people of the opposite sex in
          everyday conversations, but as a parent, it’s difficult for me to talk about that topic. Schools have speakers
          who provide education once or twice a year, so I think it’s better for them to be taught in a more objective
          manner. I find it quite good.</p>
