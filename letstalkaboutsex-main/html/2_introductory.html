        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The ideology that has been embed in Asian county, mostly East Asia,
        traditional family system is Confucianism. Sex in Confucianism is an act only for the birth and has meaning in
        the purity and succession of lineage. Sexuality centered on childbirth made sex a restricted topic throughout
        old Asian society, and it remains a universal perception of sex even till these days. In other words, this
        society recognizes sex as a private and taboo area that is secretly shared. The Confucian sex culture, which
        prohibits sex, does not convey information about sex accurately even in official educational settings, and even
        at home, children are indifferent to sex and think that the less they know, the better. As young children grow
        up in this sociocultural background, they form a negative perception of sex from an early age. As they grow
        older, they naturally develop sexual curiosity and may have an extreme attitude of having excessive sexual
        interest more than necessary.
        <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Censorship significantly hinders the open discussion of sexual content
        in our daily lives, leading to instances where sex remains a taboo subject. There are examples that show how sex
        is still seen as something embarrassing or forbidden. For example, the well-known Netflix show <text
          class="highlight"><span id="click-item-1">“Sex Education” is translated into “Otis’s
            Secret
            Clinic,</span></text> and another
        show called
        <text class="highlight" id="click-item-2">
          “The Year I Started Masturbating” is changed to “The Year I Started That.”
        </text>

        Furthermore, additional instances can be observed in Japanese anime where characters originally shown wearing
        bikinis are modified to have more clothing coverage.
        <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;With this social context, for my interviews with women in their 50s and
        60s from South Korea, I aimed to delve into their knowledge and experiences with birth control pills. As we
        engaged in conversations, it became evident that they had grown up in a culture that was considerably
        conservative when it came to discussing matters of sex and related topics. They shared that open dialogues about
        contraception, including birth control pills, were relatively scarce during their formative years. However,
        despite these societal limitations, they expressed their happiness and enthusiasm about participating in the
        interview. They recognized it as a valuable opportunity to candidly share their personal journeys, shedding
        light on how they navigated the realm of birth control when such discussions were less prevalent. Through their
        willingness to engage in this dialogue, they demonstrated a genuine desire to contribute to collective knowledge
        and help others gain insights into their unique perspectives.
        <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The interview began with a question about whether they had ever used
        birth control pills. I believed that it was a relatively easy topic to start the conversation and gradually
        discuss sex and their personal experiences. The participants mainly included my mom’s friends, some of whom I
        had known since I was very young. However, not all participants were receptive to the interviews. Some who I
        couldn’t include in my project gave rather short and disinterested answers, displaying a lack of engagement.
        Others outright refused to participate, showing discomfort when it came to discussing about sex.
        <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It’s important to recognize that the participants’ sexual misconceptions
        and their lack of openness in discussing sex can be attributed, at least in part, to Pierre Bourdie’s concept of habitus. Bourdieu argued that habitus encompasses individuals’ deeply ingrained dispositions and behaviors
        shaped by their socialization within a particular social context. Understanding the participants’ habitus helps
        us recognize that their misconceptions and lack of openness are not solely their fault. Rather, it reflects the
        broader social structures, norms, and limited access to comprehensive sexual education that shape their habitus.
        By considering this, we can approach the topic with empathy and work towards promoting more informed and open
        discussions about sex.
